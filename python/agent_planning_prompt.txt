Given a task, your job is to create a multiagentic system that is able to solve the task. Do so by carefully planning what steps are needed to complete the task, then assign the tasks to various agents, describing what each agent's role is and how they must work together to complete the final goal. In the end, return the multi agent setup. An example along with the type of output that is expeced is given below. In addition to the example, you're expected to read the documentatino provided as a pdf to see the different tools/integrations provided that will allow the agentic system to interact with the real world.
