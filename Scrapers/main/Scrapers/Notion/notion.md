# Notion

This module exports all workspace content from a user's Notion account.

## Functionality

The `exportNotion()` function performs these tasks:
1. Checks if the user is connected to Notion.
2. Navigates through the Notion interface to reach the export dialog.
3. Initiates the export of all workspace content.
 
## Implementation

The Notion export process is implemented as follows:
1. The function checks if the current page is Notion, navigating to it if not.
2. It verifies user authentication, prompting for sign-in if needed.
3. The function navigates through the Notion interface by:
   - Clicking the workspace dropdown
   - Accessing Settings through two separate button clicks
   - Selecting "Export all workspace content"
   - Confirming the export
4. The process uses `waitForElement()` to ensure UI elements are present before interacting.
5. Error handling is implemented throughout the process.

## Platform-specific Considerations

1. DOM Manipulation: The module relies on specific class names, roles, and text content to navigate the Notion interface.
2. Timing: The `wait()` function is used to account for page load and animation times.
3. Scrolling: Elements are scrolled into view before clicking to ensure visibility.
4. IPC Communication: The module uses Electron's IPC to communicate with the main process for actions like connecting to the website.

## Future Improvements

1. Error Handling: While error handling is implemented, it could be further enhanced for each step of the process.
2. Dynamic Waiting: Replace fixed waits with more dynamic waiting for elements to appear or change.
3. Selective Export: Add options to export specific pages or sections instead of the entire workspace.
4. Progress Tracking: Implement a way to track and report the export progress beyond the current step logging.
